This is a simple echo server and client program. The server will echo
back whatever the server sends it.

You can run the Server-Main and then the Client-Main in your IDE to test
it out.

Thanks to [mjansen's echo server](https://github.com/mjansen401/java/tree/master/Echo) and the [Princeton CS Networking documentation](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/84network/) on
servers.
